# Pet House Application

## Overview  
The **Pet House Application** is a user-friendly web application designed to help users find and adopt pets from various categories. The app displays a list of available pets with their details, allows users to filter pets by category, and includes features like adding pets to a favorites list. Users can also adopt a pet, triggering a countdown in a modal that confirms their adoption.

## Features  
- **View Available Pets**: Browse through a variety of pets available for adoption.  
- **Filter by Category**: Easily navigate through different categories of pets.  
- **Adoption Process**: Adopt a pet with a confirmation modal.  
- **Spinning process**: If your internet connection is slow and unable to load the category quickly, you will see a spinning icon for a while. Otherwise, you will see it when the page is refreshed.  
- **Favorite Pets**: Add your favorite pets to a list for easy reference.
